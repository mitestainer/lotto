# Lotto 🍀

This is a simple app I made to practice the mechanics of React. There's nothing fancy about UX here; I made this project simply to play with state management using Hooks. It took me around 1 day to build this app.

You can access the app [here](https://mitestainer.github.io/lotto/).

## Overview

This Lotto game features 4 different modes, each of them based on 4 real lottos from [Loterias Caixa](http://loterias.caixa.gov.br/wps/portal/loterias/): 

- 🟩 Mega Lotto, based on Mega Sena
- 🟦 Corner Lotto, based on Quina
- 🟪 E-Z Lotto, based on Lotofácil
- 🟧 Frenzy Lotto, based on Lotomania

The player must select a determined number of 'guesses' and click _Draw_ to check if their guesses are correct or not.

## I think your project is too _meh_

Please let me know if you have any ideas on how I can improve this app!
